\emph{Search for evidence in the pcap file that indicates which kind of web browser was
used by the user?}


\section{Task 2}\label{task2}
To view only the traffic inside the local network, we employ a display filter in wireshark to show only traffic with destination and source subnet from our own IP-address. Our own IP is most likely 141.13.99.136 and thus we choose 141.13.99.0/24 as subnet filter. This results in only 137 pakets which can be seen in %\autoref{img_wireshark_overview}.

We can see a dropbox service running and mainly NBNS and BROWSER traffic broadcasted in the local network. As an example we analyze one of the BROWSER pakets. %(see \autoref{img_wireshark_browser}).
A host with name "SHADY" running Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2 is available on IP-address 141.13.99.130.
