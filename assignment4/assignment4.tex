\section{Task 1}\label{task1}
In the pcap file we found a packet that uses the Simple Service Discovery Protol, where the USER-AGENT is specified as Google Chrome, as depicted in Figure~\ref{wireshark_evidence}.

\section{Task 2}\label{task2}
To view only the traffic inside the local network, we employ a display filter in wireshark to show only traffic within the subnet of our own IP-address. We choose 141.13.99.0/24 as this filter. An excerpt of the filtered traffic can be seen in Figure~\ref{img_wireshark_overview}.

We can see a dropbox service running and mainly NBNS and BROWSER traffic broadcasted in the local network. As an example we analyze one of the BROWSER pakets (see Figure~\ref{img_wireshark_browser}).
A host with name "SHADY" running Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2 is available on IP-address 141.13.99.130.

Additionally, we are able to retrieve a GeoIP entry stating that all examined packets were issued in Bamberg by the ``Verein zur Foerderung eines Deutschen Forschungsnetzes e.V." (see Figure~\ref{img_wireshark_geoip}).
